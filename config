   # Type of network installation
   # 0 - Ethernet (default)
   # 1 - ADSL
   # 2 - Dial-up
   # 3 - No network setup
   # If you select 4 the GLIS will skip the emerge sync phase of the install,
   # instead using the portage snapshot specified by PORTAGE_TREE.  This will
   # install older software, but internet access is not needed. This will NOT
   # disable network access from the liveCD.  It just doesn't use the net
   # during the install.
   #
   # If NET_INSTALL_TYPE is not set, it defaults to 0
   NET_INSTALL_TYPE="0"

   # The network interface defaults to DHCP (by omision of any of the below).

   # The 'x' within the brackets ('[' and ']') needs to be replaced with the

   #    IFACE_POST
   #    IFACE_IP
   #    IFACE_NETMASK
   #    IFACE_BROADCAST
   # IFACE_POST represents the interface name (i.e. eth0, wlan0) and must
   # be specified if you want the device configured.
   # If any of the last three are NOT set, the interface will default to DHCP.
   #
   # There is 1 variable that is optional:

# Dial-up Settings #
#------------------#
   # Note: These settings will currently only be used for installing GLIS,
   # not for post install configuration.

   # Dial-up settings
   # All three of these must be set if you plan to use dial-up. Failure
   # to set any of these will likely result in a failed install. Currently
   # the password must be in plain text.
   # Note: If you want to use dial-up as your method for installing then
   # be sure to appropriately set NET_INSTALL_TYPE.
   #DIALUP_USERNAME="bxxxnxnx"
   #DIALUP_PASSWORD="xxxx"
   #DIALUP_NUMBER="1234567890"

   # Set this to 1 if you want glis to fetch all files before compiling and
   # installing a set of packages. Set to 0 or leave unset if you want your
   # internet connection to be active throughout the entire install.
   # Note: This is currently unsupported. Your dialup connection will be
   # active throughout the install process and you will need to manually
   # terminate it after the install completes. To terminate the dial-up
   # run the command: killall wvdial
   #DIALUP_ON_DEMAND="0"

#---------------------------#
# DSL (PPPOE only) Settings #
#---------------------------#

   # Future DSL configuration options
   # !!! None of this has been implemented in GLIS !!!

   # To use DSL for the install remember to set NET_INSTALL_TYPE=1.

   #DSL_USERNAME="bxxxnxnx@sympatico.ca"
   #DSL_PASSWORD="xxxx"

   # Activate on demand
   # If you want the link to come up on demand, enter the value in seconds

   # unset the link will stay up permanently.

#-----------------#
# Partition Setup #
#-----------------#

   # Partition Guidelines:
   # This is how I think partitioning should be setup.
   # DISCLAIMER!!!!!! Wrong settings here WILL screw up your system!!!!
   # BE CAREFUL!!!
   # Again, x = partition number (this does NOT correspond to the /dev/hdax
   # number). x should simply increase (starting at 0) as you add partitions
   # to this file
   
   # This is pretty self explanitory.
   # Partition 'x' refers to "/dev/hda2" device.
   # To mount an NFS partition use PARTITION[x]="server:/path/to/mountpoint"
   # and be sure to add a PARTITION_MOUNT entry.
   PARTITION[0]="/dev/hda1"
   PARTITION[1]="/dev/hda2"
   PARTITION[2]="/dev/hda3"
   
   # This is how big the partition should be.
   # NOTE: if this is NOT NULL, the partition will be erased and repartitioned!
   # NOTE: THIS MEANS TOTAL DATA LOSS!!!
   # If this is not set, then it will use the existing partition(s) on the drive
   # It should follow the below options for sizing:
   PARTITION_SIZE[0]="32M" # Size in MB
   PARTITION_SIZE[1]="128M" # Size in MB
   PARTITION_SIZE[2]="@" # Fill to the end of the disk

   #PARTITION_SIZE[x]="40%" # Size in % of total drive space
   #PARTITION_SIZE[x]="@" 
   # This special character ('@')means to take up the rest of the drive
   # If you are set up GLIS to save the partition AFTER the current one, 
   # '@' will fill up to that partition
   
   # This determines whether or not a partition gets formated.
   # ie. If it is set to ext3, it will format the partition for ext3
   # If it is not set, the partition will not be formated.
   # If the drive has been repartitioned and this is not set, install will fail
   # because drive will have no usable format.
   # Valid types are:
   #  - ext2
   #  - ext3
   #  - reiserfs
   #  - xfs
   #  - jfs
   #  - swap
   #  - extended
   #  - nfs
   # (NOTE: "extended" is for extended partitions. All paritions after
   # partition number 4 (ie. /dev/hda5) will be placed in the extended
   # partition.) Also, only 1 extended partition can be defined.
   PARTITION_TYPE[0]="ext3"
   PARTITION_TYPE[1]="swap"
   PARTITION_TYPE[2]="ext3"
   
   # This is the mount point for the partition.
   # This is relative to the new (chroot) system
   # ie. '/' will mount to /mnt/gentoo/
   # For swap partitions, the proper mount point is "swap"
   PARTITION_MOUNT[0]="/boot"
   PARTITION_MOUNT[1]="swap"
   PARTITION_MOUNT[2]="/"
      
   # This should cover just about all partitioning needs.  Any that aren't
   # covered by this can and should be added into a frontend.  The front end
   # can do all the partitioning and then just pass the mounting and/or
   # formating to glis.
   
   # I also want to get NFS mounts in here as well, but it is not setup in the
   # fstab config yet, so we'll have to do that after we get the initial part
   # working.   

#----------------------#
# Installation Options #
#----------------------#

   # Which type install should we perform?
   # Options are 1-3
   # 1 - Bootstrap(Source), Emerge System(Source)
   # 2 - Bootstrap(Binary), Emerge System(Source)
   # 3 - Bootstrap(Binary), Emerge System(Binary)
   INSTALL_STAGE=1

   # Stage Tarball Location
   # This includes the name of the tarball
   # ie. "/mnt/zip/myowntarball.tar.bz2"
   # If not defined, it automatically gets the appropriate stage tarball from
   # the CD.
   # Optionally you can specify a tarball's url, with either an http:// or

   # PORTAGE_TREE="/path/to/portage-snapshot.tar.bz2"
   # If PORTAGE_TREE is not set then the portage tree will not be
   # touched. This is useful if you plan to remotely mount a portage tree.
   # When set to "SYNC", GLIS will run an 'emerge sync'. If you have
   # NET_INSTALL_TYPE=3, then do not set to SYNC!
   # When set to anything else GLIS will untar/compress the portage tree
   # to /usr/portage. Note that only tar bz2 files will be accepted.

   # To add verbosity to binary packages, add "-kv"

#--------------#
# Config Files #
#--------------#

   # Rather than just appending the whole set of config files to this file
   # it will be easier to do something more tactful.
   # Here is the syntax for config files:
   # #== /path/to/config.file?SETTING="option1 options2"
   #
   # So for example, you could do the following:
   # #== /etc/make.conf?USE="X gnome gtk alsa"
   # #== /etc/rc.conf?EDITOR="nano -w"
   #
   # NOTE: It is VERY essential that the line begins with a #==
   #
   # This method can be used for ONLY the following files:
   # /etc/rc.conf
   # /etc/make.conf
   # Other config files are generated by GLIS.

#------------------#
# Advanced Options #
#------------------#

   # Distcc hosts
   # If you wish to use distcc during the install set your distcc hosts
   # here. If no hosts are set, distcc will not be used.
   #DISTCC_HOSTS="192.168.0.1"

   # User hooks location
   # User hooks are used if you want to add additional scripting code to run
   # during a GLIS installation. Each 'hook' script will have a name that
   # follows the below format:
   # XXX-pre.sh or XXX-post.sh
   # Where XXX represents the first three digits in that steps filename.
   # i.e. if the steps filename is 100-implement_config.sh then your
   # pre and post hooks should be:
   # 100-pre.sh and 100-post.sh
   #
   # In the event that step is fully contained within the glis script, i.e.
   # steps 6, 7, and 11, use the values 060, 070, and 110, for XXX
   # respectively.
   #
   # The file MUST be a bash script, and all lower case.
   # Note that these scripts will NOT be run in the chroot environment.
   # Defaults to the current directory if not set. 
   #HOOKS_LOCATION="hooks/"


# This configuration was generated by GLIS
HOOKS_LOCATION="./"
