# GLIS README

glis is designed to automate the install of gentoo machines. it allows you to
use one of a number of methods to supply it with a config file and then just gets
on with the install without needing supervision.

there are (will be) a number of GUIs for creating the config file (we hope). its
not too hard to write a config "by hand" by hacking at the sample which comes with
glis, so we hope the current lack of a GUI will not prove an obstacle.

a standard glis gentoo install would work something like this:

1. boot somehow
2. run:
$ glis --config http://your-web-server.net/glis-config
or
$ glis --config ftp://your-ftp-server.net/glis-config
or
$ glis --config server-name:/path/to/glis-config

the machine should install gentoo according to you config, then reboot itself
and be ready to go.

thats about it...

a enterprise style install would work like this:

1. decide on some classes for your machines such as "webserver", "mailserver" etc
2. create a glis config for each type of machine
3. create a class-index.txt file which lists class names and the path to their config
4. create a boot-config for each class
4. boot a machine
5. run glis-bootstrap

the machine should install gentoo accoring to the class config and reboot

see the sample config file for details of how it works :)

enjoy!
